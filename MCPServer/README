This is a simple MCP server implementing as much of the MCP specification
as is necessary to get it running in mcp-inspector.

The server can also be used via mcpo to integrate it via the generated
OpenAPI specification into Open-WebUI as a tool.

PARAMETER:
- See --help option regarding command line arguments
- Default Port is 8000 ad can be changed via command line

NOTES:
- Parts of the protocol messages are outsourced into files and are only patched in code
- The application must be called from teh repository root directory to find these files
- mcpo call could be 'uvx mcpo --port 8888 --server-type streamable_http -- http://localhost:8000'
- The return structure is simpler as libosmscout is able to offer. It misse necessary information (distance and direction)
- Libosmscout could also return more information on location
- Further tools could be added on demand
- There is also some code to directly include it into Open-WebUI however the current OpenAPI spec
  is not yet accepted (more alignment with mcpo generated spec needed). Also further request would
  be needed to get implemented.
