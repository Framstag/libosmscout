## Mailing list

There exists a mailing list for libosmscout at sourceforge. The mailing list 
is low traffic, but you can still reach the main developers there.

You can find instructions to subscribe to the mailing list
[here](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/libosmscout-development). 

Note that you must first subscribe to the list. If you send mails to the
list before being subscribed you either have to wait for the maintainer to pass
them through (which may take a while) or they will never appear on the list at
all.

You can find a searchable archive of the mailing list
[here](https://sourceforge.net/p/libosmscout/mailman/libosmscout-development/).
       
## Matrix

There is a public matrix room at `#libosmscout.matrix.org`. While
it is a chat room, answer may take some time.
       
## Else

If everything else fails you can contact [Tim Teulings](mailto:tteuling@users.sf.net)
for more information.
