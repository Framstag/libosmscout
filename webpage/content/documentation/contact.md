The best place to ask questions about Libosmscout is on its mailinglist.

You can find instructions to subscribe to the mailinglist
[here](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/libosmscout-development). 

Note that you must first subscribe to the list. If you send mails to the
list befor beeing subscribed you either have to wait for the maintainer to pass
them through (which may take a while) or they will never appear on the list at
all.

You can find a searchable archive of the mailinglist
[here](https://sourceforge.net/p/libosmscout/mailman/libosmscout-development/).

If everything else fails you can contact [Tim Teulings](mailto:tteuling@users.sf.net)
for more information.
