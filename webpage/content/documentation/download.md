## Download

There are currently no regular source snapshots in form of downloadable archives
or versioned tarballs. You have to download the library sources and the demo
applications manually by cloning the git repository and build everything yourself.
The sources use CMake or Meson to setup the build.

You can browse the repository at https://github.com/Framstag/libosmscout.

To clone the repository use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Framstag/libosmscout.git
```

See [Building]({{< relref "/documentation/source.md" >}}) for details on how to
build the library after downloading its sources.
