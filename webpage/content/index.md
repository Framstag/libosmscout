libosmscout offers applications simple, high-level interfaces for __offline__
__location and POI lokup__, __rendering__ and __routing__ functionalities based
on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.

It does so by preprocessing *.osm or *.osm.pbf data files and generating
platform independent compact database.

The high level API offers simple datatypes and methods to fetch data based on
these datatypes for use in map drawing, location of POIs and routing.

The goals of libosmscout are:

* Enable OpenStreetMap and its rich data set
* Implement all feature required for a navigation app or application that
  want to use some subset of such features.
* Work on low-end hardware like it is commonly used for handhelds, phones and
  similar.
* Offer compact data storage making it possible to place data for countries
  and up to continents on SD cards of common size.
