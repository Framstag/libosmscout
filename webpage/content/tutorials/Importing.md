## Setup

All examples and tutorials expect the OSM export files and resulting
databases to be placed in the *maps/* sub directory.

Say, you are using the
[*nordrhein-westfalen.osm.pbf*](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/nordrhein-westfalen-latest.osm.pbf)
file from [Geofabrik](http://www.geofabrik.de/).

Download the file and rename it to nordrhein-westfalen.osm.pbf and place it
in the maps sub directory:

```bash
  $ ls maps/
  nordrhein-westfalen.osm.pbf
```

In the following text `nordrhein-westfalen` is the paceholder for the 
base name (without the suffix) of your import data file.

The examples and the `build.sh` in general assume that the Importer tool can be
called as `../Import/src/Import` (from the maps sub directory). Depending on the
actual build process the resulting executable file name and its path may differ.

## Using the bash script

Under Unix-like systems you can use the `build.sh` bash script
in the *maps/* sub directory. Go into this directory and call the
script from there as follows:

```bash
  $ ./build.sh nordrhein-westfalen.osm.pbf
```
The advantanges of the script are:

* it sources `nordrhein-westfalen.opt` if available and uses the variable
`options` as defined in this file to call the importer. This way you do not
need to pass a long list of command line arguments every time.
* it also sources `default.opt`for the same reason, if `nordrhein-westfalen.opt`
was not found.
* It passes the output of the importer to the output but also to the file
`nordrhein-westfalen.txt` in the same directory. So you can later take a look
at this file for information you missed during the import.

## Calling the importer by hand

You can also call the importer by hand. The minimum command line would be

```bash
  $ .../Import/src/Import  \
    --typefile ../stylesheets/map.ost \
    --destinationDirectory nordrhein-westfalen \
    nordrhein-westfalen.osm.pbf
```

## Crop land and sea by data polygon

When you plan to use multiple maps (databases) or combine map with other sources (render it on top of online map for example),
it is usefull to crop land and sea by some polygon. In case of data substract from Geofabrik, there are such 
polygons available in *.poly* format, for example [*nordrhein-westfalen.poly*](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/nordrhein-westfalen.poly).
You can use these polygon files directly as Import tool input beside standard data file.

```bash
  $ .../Import/src/Import  \
    --typefile ../stylesheets/map.ost \
    --destinationDirectory nordrhein-westfalen \
    --bounding-polygon nordrhein-westfalen.poly \
    nordrhein-westfalen.osm.pbf 
```

Italy without defined data polygon:

With data polygon:

<a class="screenshot" href="/images/ItalyWithDataPolygon.png"   ><img src="/images/ItalyWithDataPolygon.png"    width="460" height="380" alt="Italy imported with data polygon"/></a>

## Coastline troubleshooting

Import step evaluating coastlines and creating index for fast rendering of sea, land and unknown areas is sensitive for errors in coastline data.
When this index (`water.idx`) is incorrect, try folowing steps:

 - Verify that your cropping polygon match the imported data. 
 - Check [online Geofabric coastline inspector](http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=coastline) 
   if all coastlines in imported area are connected, they are not crossing...
 - Also check that there is no object with `natural=coastline` tag inside land area. 
   [Overpass-Turbo tool](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1aMm) may be used for such check.

To inspect where is the problem, you can use specialized `coastlines.oss` stylesheet.
It displays just coastlines and areas (sea, land, unknown) from `water.idx` index 
and country boundaries for simpler navigation.

## Adding contour lines

Some years ago, Nasa released data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRTM](SRTM)) for public use.
After some preprocessing can be those data used for creating nice maps with contour lines.

<a class="screenshot" href="/images/ContourLines.png"><img src="/images/ContourLines.png" width="460" height="332" alt="Map with contour lines"/></a>

### Required tools

Main tool for generating contour lines in OSM compatible format is `Srtm2Osm`.

Following steps are for Ubuntu 16.04.
```bash
sudo apt-get install wget unzip mono-runtime libmono-system-web-extensions4.0-cil
wget http://osm.michis-pla.net/code/Srtm2Osm-1.12.1.0.zip
unzip Srtm2Osm-1.12.1.0.zip 
wget https://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/osm-extract/polygons/poly2bb.pl
chmod +x poly2bb.pl
```

### Preprocessing

Like previous examples, this one is using `nordrhein-westfalen` region.
```bash
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/nordrhein-westfalen.poly
BBOX=`./poly2bb.pl nordrhein-westfalen.poly | awk -F '[= ]' '{print $8" "$2" "$6" "$4}'`

mono Srtm2Osm/Srtm2Osm.exe \
  -incrementid -firstnodeid $(( 1 << 33 )) -firstwayid $(( 1 << 33 )) \
  -cat 400 100 \
  -bounds1 $BBOX \
  -large \
  -maxwaynodes 256 \
  -o nordrhein-westfalen-contours.osm
```

Then, use both files `nordrhein-westfalen-contours.osm` and `nordrhein-westfalen-latest.osm.pbf` as input of Import tool.

### Data notes

`Srtm2Osm` downloads SRTMv2 data set from Nasa automatically. This dataset has poor quality in mountainous areas like Alps. 
For such areas is better to download elevation data from another source, for example 
[viewfinderpanoramas.org](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org3.htm)
that is using interpolations from more sources and it is free for non-commercial usage. 
You just need to unpack downloaded archives and copy `*.hgt` 
files into `srtm/SrtmCache` subdirectory (relative to directory where will be `Srtm2Osm` executed).

## Resulting database

The importer uses a number of import steps (currently 24) to generate a
custom database consisting of several data and index files.

Each step print itself with a header showing its running number, its name,
a short description of the task of the step, the dependend files and the
files generated. `-` announces a task, `%` prints the progress in relation
to the current task, `WW` introduces warnings and `!!` introduces errors.

```

## Optimizing the import process and resulting database

Default Import configuration should provide reasonable defaults for required memory during import, 
size of resulting database and required resources for rendering. But for some inputs may be too strict
or too generous for various special usecases. It is beneficial to know Importer options and its impact. 

 - #### Some huge area (wood, lake..) is missing on the map
   
   When you are sure that such area is present in input data, inspect import log
   and look for object id (id of OSM relation). When you find this message: `Relation XXX references too many ways (YYY)`
   consider increase default limit for relation members with argument by option `--relMaxWays`.
   This limit is here for performance reasons of redering, huge objects needs to be loaded 
   in the device memory completely and its rendering is slow. But some object are just
   huge :-) Take a look to [Finish lake "Inarij√§rvi" with 3118 members](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/402543).
